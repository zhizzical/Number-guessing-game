# Number Guessing Game 🔢
Welcome to the ultimate Number Guessing Game! Your mission? Guess the secret number between 0 and 100. Sounds easy? Think again. Each guess brings you closer to victory, but beware of the hilarious (and sometimes brutal) feedback that comes your way!

## Features
* Random Number Generator: The game picks a random number between 0 and 100, and you have to guess it.
* Witty Feedback: Forget boring feedback. You'll get sarcastic, funny, and motivational messages to spice up your guesses.
* Try Counter: Keeps track of how many attempts you make. Will you guess it in one? Or will it take more tries than you'd like to admit?
* Exit Option: Can't handle the heat? Enter -1 and bail out gracefully (or not).
* Input Validation: No room for nonsense here. Only valid numbers between 0 and 100 are accepted.
## How It Works
* A random number between 0 and 100 is secretly generated (it’s the number you’re trying to guess).
* You enter your guess.
* If it’s too low or too high, expect some clever comments like “Aim lower!” or “Too much, buddy!” to keep things interesting.
* If you hit the right number, you get a victory speech—because why not? You earned it.
* If you're done and want to quit, just enter -1 (but let’s be real, you probably won’t need to quit once you guess it).
